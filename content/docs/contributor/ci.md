Work lands on **`development`**. **`master`** is the green/release branch.

## Gates (required on development before promote)

- **Gate: packages** (`nix.yml`)
- **Gate: products** (`device-gate.yml`)
- **Gate: WLCS conformance** (`wlcs.yml`): headless Wayland protocol conformance tests via `wawona-wlcs` and WLCS test runner.

## Ship (master only)

- **Ship: beta (stores)** on push to `master`: TestFlight + Play internal (`Wawona-{calver}-{platform}-{arch}-{build}.{ext}`)
- **Ship: GitHub assets** on `v*` tags: `Wawona-{calver}-{platform}-{arch}.{ext}` (dmg / ipa / apk / AppImage)

See [Prebuilt binary naming](@/docs/contributor/prebuilt-naming.md). Do not treat Ship workflows as development gates. Do not ship stores from `development`.

Promote with a fast-forward of a green tip. Never force-push `master` or `development`.

Secrets stay in `docs/maintainers/secrets.md` (not on this site). Full matrix: [ci.md](https://github.com/Wawona/Wawona/blob/development/docs/ci.md).
