Pixels come from `wl_shm` (CPU) or GPU buffers imported through userspace DRM/KMS/GBM ([iland](@/docs/contributor/iland.md)). iland emulates connector/CRTC/plane/GBM. It never opens `/dev/dri` or `/dev/kgsl`.

On macOS **Mode A**, present is an in-window Metal layer while Aqua stays up. On **Classic Desktop Replacement** (Mode B dylib + `wwn-igetty`), WindowServer is down and iland presents fullscreen Metal. See [iland](@/docs/contributor/iland.md) and [Desktop and LockScreen](@/docs/user/desktop.md).

Zero-copy `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1` (modifiers, present sinks including IOMobileFramebuffer on TrollStore/Sileo, completion gates): [linux-dmabuf](@/docs/contributor/linux-dmabuf.md).

## Drivers

| API | Apple GPU targets | Android |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| Vulkan | KosmicKrisp (Apple Silicon + macOS 26+ default), else MoltenVK | System or SwiftShader |
| GLES / GL | ANGLE | ANGLE or system |

KosmicKrisp is macOS only. iOS, iPadOS, visionOS, and tvOS use MoltenVK. No kernel DRM/KGSL ICDs. No opening `/dev/dri` or `/dev/kgsl`.

## Platform ceilings

- **tvOS GPU** is available. OpenGL ES goes through ANGLE to Metal. Vulkan goes through MoltenVK to Metal. The Vulkan loader does not work on tvOS, so clients dispatch straight to the ICD (`WWN_VULKAN_LIBRARY`). No KosmicKrisp. No IOKit.
- **watchOS present** is SpriteKit GPU blit of SHM frames. **watchOS GL/VK** is blocked (no public Metal). `WWN_WATCHOS_METAL=1` is research only and never in the store Watch IPA.

Settings → Graphics picks the ICD. Nested clients and waypipe follow that choice.
